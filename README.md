# SkimLit Project

## Description
Through my journey in machine learning (ML), specifically in natural language processing field (NLP), I came across a tutorial of helping implementing ML models from scientific papers. I decided to take this tutorial and learn along the way every detail of how and why we coded such code, so I can get a jumpstart in this field.

I uploaded all the files associated with this project in this repo, which aims to classify the contents of medical papers' abstracts into different categories, which include observation, methods and conclusion.

## Purpose
An NLP model that makes abstracts of medical papers easier to read. It is a practice of reimplementing a machine learning model from a published scientific paper
